# Cookie Clicker Rich Presence Creator
This Cookie Clicker mod will allow you to share your game stats with everyone on Discord!

## Requirements
- Windows (macOS and Linux support soon, maybe?)
- CCSE
- The Rich Presence Cookie Clicker mod
- The Rich Presence Java Client
- Java 11 (?)

## Installation (Steam)
1) Download CCSE [here](https://klattmose.github.io/CookieClicker/SteamMods/CCSE.zip?v=2.031) and add it to your mods folder (inside the local folder preferably).
2) Download the mod for Cookie Clicker [here](https://www.google.com/). Put it in the same folder as CCSE.
3) Download the Rich Presence application [here](https://www.google.com/). Put it somewhere easily accessible.
4) Launch the application first, before enabling the mod. Upon opening the application, you should see your own Discord name and tag.
5) Enable both **CCSE** and the **Discord Rich Presence** mods. *Note: if you are using Cookie Monster, make sure to load both aforementioned mods before Cookie Monster!*
6) You should be able to see your rich presence shown on Discord!

## Installation (Browser)
Soon! Still working on adding support for it!

# Bugs/Feedback
There are times where I might've left a nasty bug in there, that's my bad! My JavaScript skills aren't the best, since I don't have a lot of experience with it. With that said, if you do spot a bug or have any issues, please [open an issue](https://github.com/angelolz1/CookieClickerRPC/issues)!
